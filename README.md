## ScanVan Project

The ScanVan project is a share initiative between the EPFL and the HES-SO Valais funded by the FNS. The goal of the project is to design and build a spherical camera in the field of mass digitisation of cities and environment for 3D/4D model computation. Along with the camera built, the project also consist in the theoretical definition of new photogrammetric algorithms taking advantage of the spherical approach of the camera toward high efficiency computation of models.
